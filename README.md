# project-earth
This project involves the development of a program that calculates the position of the sun in the sky—specifically, its compass direction (azimuth) and angle of elevation—based on given date, time, and latitude inputs. The goal is to generate a concise set of reference tables to assist in:

* Finding true North using known time and latitude

* Estimating time or latitude based on the sun’s position

Intended for application in navigation
