# project-earth
This project involves the development of a program that calculates the position of the sun in the sky—specifically, its compass direction and angle of elevation—based on given date, time, and latitude inputs. The goal is to generate a concise set of reference tables to assist in:

* Finding true North using known time

* Estimating time or latitude based on the sun’s position

Intended for application in navigation
