Find the shortest (perpendicular) distance from a point p0 with coordinates (x0, y0, z0)
to a plane with equation ax + by + cz + d = 0.

Method: 
1. Shift the reference frame so that the point is at origin
2. Find a normal to the plane through origin
3. Find the intersection of this normal with the plane
4. Find the distance from origin to the intersection


1.
p0 now has coordinates (0,0,0)

The plane now has equation:
a(x+x0) + b(y+y0) + c(z+z0) + d = 0
ax + by + cz + (ax0 + by0 + cz0 + d) = 0

2.
The normal has vector (a, b, c) and passes through (0, 0, 0)
Its parametric form is (at, bt, ct)

3.
If (aa + bb + cc) is not zero, (which it can only be if a, b and c are zero - an impossibility for a plane),
then at the intersection of the normal and the plane (formula from the intersection of a plane and a line):
t = -(0a + 0b + 0c + (ax0 + by0 + cz0 + d))/(aa + bb + cc) 
t = -(ax0 + by0 + cz0 + d)/(aa + bb + cc) 
So the intersection point is ( -a(ax0 + by0 + cz0 + d)/(aa + bb + cc) , -b(ax0 + by0 + cz0 + d)/(aa + bb + cc) , -c(ax0 + by0 + cz0 + d)/(aa + bb + cc) )

4.
The distance from origin to this intersection is:
sqrt{ (aa + bb + cc) * (ax0 + by0 + cz0 - d)^2/(aa + bb + cc)^2 }
sqrt{ (ax0 + by0 + cz0 - d)^2/(aa + bb + cc) }
abs(ax0 + by0 + cz0 - d)/sqrt(aa + bb + cc)
