Find the intersection of two planes:
ax + by + cz + d = 0    and    Ax + By + Cz + D = 0

If identical (a:A :: b:B :: c:C :: d:D), return either one of them.
If parallel (a:A :: b:B :: c:C) but not identical, return None.
If not parallel, return the Line that lies on both of them.

The vector of the intersection line is orthogonal to the normal vectors of both the planes -- it will be their cross product. The task now is to find a point that lies on both planes.
Intrsxn.vector = P1.vector×P2.vector OR P2.vector×P1.vector

Looking in the direction of that vector, the planes look like 2 lines, because we're viewing them both edge-on. If we can characterise those lines, then we can find their intersection, which must lie on the intersection line.

Each plane-line is perpendicular to both its plane and the intersection line -- its vector is therefore the cross product of its plane's vector and the intersection vector.
L1.vector = P1.vector×Intrsxn.vector OR Intrsxn.vector×P1.vector
    = P1.vector×(P1.vector×P2.vector) OR P1.vector×(P2.vector×P1.vector) OR (P1.vector×P2.vector)×P1.vector OR (P2.vector×P1.vector)×P1.vector
L2.vector = P2.vector×Intrsxn.vector OR Intrsxn.vector×P2.vector
    = P2.vector×(P1.vector×P2.vector) OR P2.vector×(P2.vector×P1.vector) OR (P1.vector×P2.vector)×P2.vector OR (P2.vector×P1.vector)×P2.vector

Each plane-line can be considered to pass through the point on its plane that is closest to origin. ('Considered' because it's not a concrete line, but a line that can be dragged through space (to trace out the plane) -- one can therefore define it as passing through any point that lies on the plane.)

The intersection of these two lines will be a point, which point should lie on both planes.
