Find any intersections of a line (parametrised by (As+B, Cs+D, Es+F), real s) and a plane (equation ax+by+cz+d=0)
There are zero if the line is 'parallel' to the plane, infinity (the whole line) if the line lies on the plane, and one in all other cases.

Essentially, check for points on the line that satisfy the requirement for being on the plane:
a(As+B) + b(Cs+D) + c(Es+F) + d = 0
aAs + aB + bCs + bD + cEs + cF + d = 0



For the line to lie on the plane all the constants and coefficients have to independently add up to zero, otherwise changing s will change the RHS.

This can be shown by rearranging as follows:
aAs + bCs + cEs = -(aB + bD + cF + d) for all s
(aA + bC + cE)s = -(aB + bD + cF + d) for all s
The only way this is possible for all s is if the parenthesised expressions are zero.

If only the coefficient of s is zero:
0s = -k is what the equation will look like.
This can never happen, so no solutions <=> no intersections (the line is parallel to the plane).


If only the constant (RHS) is zero:
ks = 0 is what the equation will look like.
This is true only when s is zero. So one intersection (0A + B, 0C + D, 0E + F)

If neither is zero:
s = -(aB + bD + cF + d)/(aA + bC + cE)
One intersection (As+B, Cs+D, Es+F), plugging the value of s above.
This and the above case can be merged, since if RHS is zero, the formula for this case correctly gives s as zero.
