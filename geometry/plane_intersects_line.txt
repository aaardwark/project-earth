Find any intersections of a line (parametrised by (As+B, Cs+D, Es+F), real s) and a plane (equation ax+by+cz+d=0)
There are infinity (the whole line) if the line lies on the plane, zero if the line is 'parallel' to the plane, and one in all other cases.

Essentially, check for points on the line that satisfy the requirement for being on the plane:
a(As+B) + b(Cs+D) + c(Es+F) + d = 0
aAs + aB + bCs + bD + cEs + cF + d = 0
(aA + bC + cE)s = -(aB + bD + cF + d)

For the line to lie on the plane, the s coefficients have to add up to zero. If they don't, changing s will change the LHS.
The only way this is possible for all s is if both parenthesised expressions are zero.

If just the coefficient of s is zero:
The equation will look like 0s = -k, kâ‰ 0, which is impossible, so no solutions. The line is parallel to the plane.

If the coefficient of s is nonzero:
s = -(aB + bD + cF + d)/(aA + bC + cE)
One intersection (As+B, Cs+D, Es+F), plugging the value of s above.
