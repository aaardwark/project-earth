Find any intersections of a plane p1 (equation ax + by + cz + d = 0) 
and another plane p2 (equation Ax + By + Cz + D = 0)

There are none if the planes are parallel, a plane if they lie on each other, a line in all other cases.
For them to lie on each other one LHS has to be a multiple of the other LHS.

Assuming nonzero c and C,
z = (ax + by + d)/c 
z = (Ax + By + D)/C

So for the locus L of points that lie on both planes, their x and y coordinates satisfy:
(ax + by + d)/c = (Ax + By + D)/C
C(ax + by + d) = c(Ax + By + D)
Cax + Cby + Cd = cAx + cBy + cD
Cax - cAx + Cby - cBy + Cd - cD = 0

In ax+by+c=0 format:
x(Ca - cA) + y(Cb - cB) + (Cd - cD) = 0
This equation represents the projection of L onto the xy plane.

(Note that this only requires one of c and C to be nonzero. 
Visually, at least one of the planes has to be non-vertical. 
If both are vertical, the projection is a point.)

Parametrise this equation: 
x = -(Cb-cB)t
y = (Ca-cA)t - (Cd-cD)/(Cb-cB)
This is undefined if either: c = C = 0 (the projection is a point) 
or: Cb = cB (projection of the form x = k; note this is true when c = C = 0), which can be further broken down into either: c = C and b = B, or: c = b and C = B

Case "c = C = 0":
The projected point's x- and y-coordinates satisfy ax + by + d = 0 and Ax + By + D = 0

Case "Cb = cB":
The project line has equation x(Ca - cA) + 0y + (Cd - cD) = 0
x = -(Cd - cD)/(Ca - cA)
Its parametrisation is ( -(Cd - cD)/(Ca - cA) , t )
Alternately, to avoid zero division ( -(Cd - cD) , (Ca - cA)t )



To get the z-coordinate we have to plug the parametrisations back into one of the planes' equation.
(The plane should have a nonzero z-coefficient. 
Visually, the plane has to be non-vertical so there is a unique z-coordinate)
z = (ax + by + d)/c  (let's say p1 is non-vertical)
z = [-a(Cb-cB)t + b(Ca-cA)t - b(Cd-cD)/(Cb-cB) + d]/c
z = [(acB-bcA)t + d - (bdC-bcD)/(Cb-cB)]/c
