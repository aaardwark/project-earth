Find the intersection of two planes:
ax + by + cz + d = 0
Ax + By + Cz + D = 0

If identical (a:A :: b:B :: c:C :: d:D), return either one of them.
If parallel (a:A :: b:B :: c:C) but not identical, return None.
If not parallel, return the Line that lies on both of them.

For now ignore d and D, treating both planes as if they pass through origin. Then:
ax + by + cz = 0 = Ax + By + Cz
Cax + Cby + Ccz = 0 = cAx + cBy + cCz
Cax + Cby = - cCz = cAx + cBy
(Ca - cA)x + (Cb - cB)y = (- cCz) - (- cCz) = 0
(Ca - cA)x = (cB - Cb)y

Hence x : y  ::  (cB - Cb) : (Ca - cA)
One x, y pair is (cB - Cb) , (Ca - cA)
Now find z such that the resulting point lies on the plane (the one through origin).
ax + by + cz = 0
a(cB - Cb) + b(Ca - cA) + cz = 0
acB - aCb + bCa - bcA + cz = 0
acB - bcA + cz = 0
cz = bcA - acB
z = (bA - aB)

We already know that both planes pass through (0,0,0) 
So we can say that the intersection line has vector:
( (cB - Cb) , (Ca - cA) , (bA - aB) )
This vector is zero when aB = -bA and cB = -Cb and Ca = -cA


The task now is to find a point that lies on both of the original planes (accounting for d and D).
Going back to the planes' equations:

ax + by + d = -cz   and   Ax + By + D = -Cz
C(ax + by + d) = -Ccz   and   c(Ax + By + D) = -Ccz
C(ax + by + d) - c(Ax + By + D) = (-Ccz) - (-Ccz)
(Ca-cA)x + (Cb-cB)y + (Cd-cD) = 0
(Ca-cA)x + (Cb-cB)y = cD - Cd

One possible x, y pair is (Cb-cB) - Cd/(Ca-cA), cD/(Cb-cB) - (Ca-cA)
Then: a( (Cb-cB) - Cd/(Ca-cA) ) + b( cD/(Cb-cB) - (Ca-cA) ) + d = -cz
[or equally well A( (Cb-cB) - Cd/(Ca-cA) ) + B( cD/(Cb-cB) - (Ca-cA) ) + D = -Cz]

But c might be zero and we cannot safely divide by it.
We need x and y to be divisible by c so it can be factored and cancelled out rather than divided out. 
Eg: if x=cX and y=cY, and -cz = ax + by + d, then -cz = acX + bcY + d
Multiply our entire equation in x and y by cd.

cd(Ca-cA)x + cd(Cb-cB)y = ccdD - Ccdd
cd(Ca-cA)[cd(Cb-cB) + ccdD/cd(Ca-cA)] + cd(Cb-cB)[- cd(Ca-cA) - Ccdd/cd(Cb-cB)] = ccdD - Ccdd

[cd(Cb-cB) + ccdD/cd(Ca-cA)] , [- cd(Ca-cA) - Ccdd/cd(Cb-cB)]
a[cd(Cb-cB) + ccdD/cd(Ca-cA)] + b[- cd(Ca-cA) - Ccdd/cd(Cb-cB)] + d = -cz
acd(Cb-cB) - bcd(Ca-cA)  + accdD/cd(Ca-cA) - bCcdd/cd(Cb-cB) + cz = -d
