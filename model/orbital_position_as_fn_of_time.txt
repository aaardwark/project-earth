Find the position of a body in an elliptical orbit about another body as a function of time.

For a body in a circular orbit, it is easy to find position as a function of time - the rate of motion and the rate of angular motion are constant throughout the orbit. This is not so for a body in elliptical orbit. Rate of motion and rate of angular motion vary. They obey laws, such as Kepler's second law: "A line joining an orbiting body and the central body sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time."

The model:
A central body, at point S, one focus of the ellipse
A point P, the orbiting body - which moves around the ellipse
Point Z, the perihelion, the point at which the orbiting body is closest to the central body
Point C, the centre of the ellipse, the midpoint of the foci

Known variables:
t, the time since perihelion, the point when P coincided with Z
a, the length of the semimajor axis (the longer 'radius'), |CZ|
e, the eccentricity (parameter of an ellipse - see bottom), |CS|/a
b, the length of the semiminor axis (shorter radius), a*sqrt(1-e^2)

The source has chosen to express e in terms of a, and then b in terms of a and e, assuming that both foci are known.
Alternatively, if only one focus but both a and b are known, e can be expressed in terms of a and b and point C derived from that.
a, the length of the semimajor axis (the longer 'radius'), |CZ|
b, the length of the semiminor axis (shorter radius)
e, the eccentricity (parameter of an ellipse - see bottom), sqrt(1 - b^2/a^2)



USE OF A LABELLED FIGURE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO UNDERSTAND THE FOLLOWING. LINK TO AN IMAGE IS PROVIDED ABOVE

Consider a circle centred at C with the major axis as a diameter - in a way, the ellipse stretched along its minor axis till it becomes a circle.
let X be the projection of the orbiting body to this circle - where P would go if such a stretch was performed
let Y be the point on the circle such that the sector areas |ZSX| and |ZCY| are equal
let M be the 'mean anomaly', the angle between Z and Y as seen from C, ∠ZCY

Due to the stretch, the sector areas are related by |ZSP| = b/a * |ZSX|
By the formula for the area of a sector of a circle, the circular sector area |ZCY| equals a^2M/2

Using the statements above, the area swept since perihelion, |ZSP| equals b/a * |ZSX| = b/a * |ZCY| = b/a * a^2M/2 = abM/2
Kepler's second law states that this area is proportional to time since perihelion.
So since abM/2 is proportional to time since perihelion, and a and b are constants, the mean anomaly, M, is proportional to the time, t, since perihelion.
The constant of proportionality is the 'mean motion', the average angular velocity of P about S, (2π rad)/T, where T is the orbital period.

When the mean anomaly M is computed, the goal is to compute the true anomaly θ. The function θ = f(M) is, however, not elementary.
Kepler's solution is to use an intermediate variable 
E, the eccentric anomaly, the angle between Z and X as seen from C, ∠ZCX

First compute E as a function of M by solving Kepler's equation below, and then compute the true anomaly θ = ∠ZSP from the eccentric anomaly E.

Earlier, Y was defined such to satisfy |ZCY| = |ZSX|
|ZSX| = |ZCX| - |SCX|
Hence |ZCY| = |ZCX| - |SCX|
By the formula for the area of a sector of a circle, |ZCX| = a^2E/2
By the formula for the area of a triangle, |SCX| = 1/2 *|CS|*|DX| = (ae * a sin E)/2 = (e sin E) * a^2/2
Now we have a^2M/2 = a^2E/2 - (e sin E) * a^2/2
Division by a^2/2 gives Kepler's equation M = E - e sin E
Remember that M = t(2π/T), where t is the time since perihelion, and T is the orbital period.

[IMPORTANT]
This equation gives M as a function of E, whereas we want to find E for a given M.
That is the inverse problem, which can be approximately solved using iterative numerical algorithms.
Rearrange Kepler's equation as E = M + e sin E
Now create a sequence E, defined by Ei+1 = e sin Ei + M
Let E0 take some arbitrary value, keeping in mind that -π < E ≤ π
The sequence converges on the exact value of E, and can be calculated with arbitrary precision as a function of t, depending only on how many terms of the sequence are computed.


Cartesian position coordinates of the orbiting body with reference to the centre of ellipse are (a cos E, b sin E)
With reference to the central body, whose coordinates relative to the centre are (|CS| = ae, 0), they are (a cos E – ae, b sin E)
Remember: E is an angle, measured relative to the perihelion.

The source continues on to derive polar coordinates, but as the present use case is entirely in cartesian coordinates the remainder of the derivation is not reproduced.

Choose a line and call it 'the directrix'
Choose a point not lying on the line and call it 'the focus'
Any conic section can be defined as the set of all points, each of whose distance to the focus and the directrix are in a constant ratio. That ratio is called the eccentricity.
